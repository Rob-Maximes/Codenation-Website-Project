            <p class="review-content">Michael Zwierzanski was the travel specialist who orchestrated our fabulous trip to Japan. He thought of and addressed every little detail that made our trip flawless and truly memorable. From Mike's exceptional dining recommendations to our timely transportation to the spectacular hotel accommodations, every aspect of the trip was well thought out. We would be delighted to work with Michael and CodeNation Travel again. - Batman & Robin.

            <p class="review-content">This was the 4th time we had used Codenation Travel to plan and book our adventure - this time to the Greek island of Rhodes. As always, the planning and preparation were superb and the activities we had been offered and chosen turned out to be excellent. Even though our holidays have been 'prepared' for us, there is always enough flexibility to do our own thing but we are always safe in the knowledge that Codenation has our backs. - Elon Musk

            <p class="review-content">Myself and my 25 mates had a great time in Germany and the experience was even duller than expected. We managed to bore our entire nation backing us by playing a stale brand of football. Although we used Codenation Travel several times and as before the holiday was arranged specifically to our requirements including us extending the holiday as we progressed through the knockout stages. - Gareth "i wear goggles in the shower" Southgate.
